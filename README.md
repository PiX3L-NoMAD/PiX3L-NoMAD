# Hi, I’m Janilee 👋

Junior product engineer in London, working across the full stack with TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node and PostgreSQL.

Film and acting background, so I think in scenes and user journeys, not just functions.

---

### What I’ve built lately

- **AuthForge** – Mock identity platform for games/apps.  
  Focused on login and registration with JWTs, token expiry and storing user data, inspired by real-world account systems.

- **Eventify** – Community events hub.  
  React/TypeScript + Node/Express + PostgreSQL, Firebase auth and Google Calendar so users can actually save what they sign up for.

- **NC News** – Full-stack news app.  
  REST API in Express/PostgreSQL with Jest/Supertest, plus a React front end for browsing, sorting and commenting.

- **Law-Vely** – Making UK legislation readable.  
  Team project using TypeScript, React and Tailwind, pulling from the UK legislation API and using OpenAI to summarise legal texts for normal humans.

- **Rare Souls Films & Driving School** – Marketing-style sites.  
  Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind builds where the main goal is clarity: what is this, why should I care, how do I contact you.

### Tech I use

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind  
- **Backend & data:** Node, Express, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, a bit of DynamoDB  
- **Workflow:** Git/GitHub, Jest, Supertest, CI-ish habits from bootcamp (small commits, tests before bragging)

### What I’m looking for

- Early-career product / full-stack roles  
- Modern TypeScript stack (React/Next + Node/Express/Nest + SQL)  
- A team where I can own small features, learn the product properly and keep levelling up as a product engineer
